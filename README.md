Functionality project of timestramp for freeCodeCamp Back End Development and APIs, where I build a functionality to parse a json with an timestamp, using Node.js and Express.js. At this challenging the date the client sent is retrieved as query, for the challeng purporses the date is estipulated to be GMT(Meaning the date inserted is <year>:<day>:<month>)

To test this project your can either clone this project localy and test it, with the prospect that will be tested as said above or open in replit and just click the green button RUN.
